Context
You are aboard a spaceship traveling through space when it gets struck by a meteor shower. It is your daily routine to clean some meteors.

How to Play Our Game

To grab the bullet: Press the trigger button on the left controller.
To fire the bullet: Press the trigger button of the right controller. (Make sure to press all the way in, otherwise it will not be detected).
To teleport: Press the joystick button on the right controller.
