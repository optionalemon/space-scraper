Context
You are aboard a spaceship traveling through space when it gets struck by a meteor shower. It is your daily routine to clean some meteors.

How to Play Our Game
You will need to grab the bullet on the desk beside you (which will provide ammunition and do our daily cleaning routine) and shoot as many meteors (that are flying around) as possible

To grab the bullet: Press the grip button on the left controller. (Each bullet grabbed will provide 1,000 actual shooting bullets, which will be displayed on the UI.).
To fire the bullet: Press the trigger button of the right controller. (Make sure to press all the way in, otherwise it will not be detected).
To teleport: Press the joystick button on the right controller.

When a meteor is hit by a bullet: If you shoot a meteor, it will break into pieces, and the total meteor shot count will be displayed on the UI.

- Used Prefabs inside to build spaceship and the details
- Used Space Waste Prefab as the target in the game. This prefab does NOT come with the Breakable.cs script (which detects collisions and simulates the breaking animation), a Box Collider, or a Rigidbody component. All of these were manually coded and added by the team.
